        <title>Verb + Object + Infinitive / Gerund</title>
        <content>
            VERB + OBJECT + TO + INFINITIVE
            --------------------------------------------------------------------

            1. Zazwyczaj używamy Verbs + object + to + infinitive z czasownikami:

            ask,
            advise,
            allow,
            eg,
            cause,
            enable,
            encourage, expect,
            force,
            help,
            intend
            invite,
            mean, order,
            persuade,
            recommend,
            remind,
            take (time),
            teach,
            tell,
            warn

            Po advise, persuade, remind, teach, tell, warn można użyć OBJECT + THAT:
            HE ADVISED ME THAT I should stay off work for two weeks.

            Po RECOMMEND można użyć:
            OBJECT + TO + INFINITIVE: HE RECOMMENDED ME TO TAKE some cash.
            a THAT clause: HE RECOMMENDED THAT I TOOK

            1. We EXPECT THE FLIGHT TO ARRIVE at 19.50
            2. It TOOK ME AGES TO GET there
            3. She ADVISED HIM NOT TO TRAVEL by train

            ===================================================================

            2. Używamy także OBJECT + TO + INFINITIVE z:

            want,
            would like,
            would love,
            would prefer,
            would hate,

            Po tych słowach NIE MOŻNA używać THAT.

            1. I WOULD HATE YOU TO THINK that I don't appreciate your offer of help
            2. I'D LIKE YOU TO SEND me the bill.

            ===================================================================

            3. Po arrange, ask, plan, wait umieszczamy FOR zaraz po czasowniku, przed TO + INFINITIVE

            1. I'm WAITING FOR MY FRIEND TO ARRIVE
            2. We've ARRANGED FOR A TAXI TO COME at 6.30

            VERB + OBJECT + INFINITIVE (WITHOUT TO)
            --------------------------------------------------------------------

            Object + infinitive (without to) uzywamy zazwyczaj po:

            let,
            make,
            help

            1. Please LET ME EXPLAIN!
            2. He MADE ME FEEL really guilty!
            3. Can you HELP ME DO the washing up?

            UWAGA1 !!!
            Help może być używane z TO lub bez.

            UWAGA2 !!!
            Gdy używamy MAKE SB DO STH w PASSIVIE jest to zawsze poprzedzone TO + INFINITIVE

            1. We were MADE TO CLEAN our rooms every morning.

            VERB + OBJECT + GERUND
            --------------------------------------------------------------------

            1. Please don't KEEP ME WAITING!
            2. I DISLIKE PEOPLE TELLING me what to do.
            3. I DON'T MIND YOU SMOKING in the garden.
