            When I sleep and I have dream it is simiar to monty phyton movies. It is very abstract.
            Sometimes I dream about something what has already done, but I haven't dreamed about future.
            I think dreams know nothing it is only chemical reaction in our brain but sometimes is very pleasing.

        <content>
            I think typical problem with teenage is generation gap.
            Parents don't even know about nowadays teenage life so they minimalize teenage problems.
            On the other hand teenage can't comunicate with their parents so they can't understanding each other.
            I think solution to a poblem is compromise but nobody likes it.

            Good time to leave parents is when you go to study to other city and you must live on your own.
            Live on own hand teaches a lot. How to organize daily life.
